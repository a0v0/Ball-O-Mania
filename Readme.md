## Important Note

When I uploaded this repo to git I enabled git lfs. Now when I tried to clone the repo locally, and ran `git lfs fetch --all`, lfs objects went missing.

I tried so hard but, recovery of original files is not possible.
Moreover, since Play Store requires all the apps to target latest version of Android API, the app is not available on Google Play Store.

But  the apk was  (maybe is) available on Google Play Console. So I have downloaded the APK and attaching with this release so that in the future, I can show it to others or play for myself.

The APK is also avaialble in the repo in `apk` folder.
