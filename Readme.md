# Ball-O-Mania

First game of my life that I created when I was in 10th class. This Game was created by Unity3D game engine.

playstore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starland.ballomania

## Important Note

When I uploaded this repo to git I enabled git lfs. Now when I tried to clone the repo locally, and ran `git lfs fetch --all`, lfs objects went missing. I tried so hard but, recovery of original files is not possible.

Moreover, since Play Store requires all the apps to target latest version of Android API, the app is not available on Google Play Store.

But the apk was (maybe is) available on Google Play Console. So I have downloaded the APK and attached the apk with the release so that in the future, I can show it to others or play for myself.

The APK is also avaialble in the repo in `apk` folder.
